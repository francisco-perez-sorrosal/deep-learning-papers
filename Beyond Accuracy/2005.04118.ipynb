    "  - Sometimes we focus on a measure and we put it as a single goal, we distort the measure (what is call Capmbell's law in eductaion. Originally: \"But when test scores become the goal of the teaching process, they both lose their value as indicators of educational status and distort the educational process in undesirable ways\")\n",
    "  - This methodology allows to alleviate/avoid that\n",

    "- As it happened with TDD/BDD in the SWE, in most of the companies/environments probably:\n",

    "  1. Ppl will be reluctant to apply this as they think they already know the underlying problem (Dunning-Krugger effect?)\n",
    "  2. Extra burden that will be avoided by managers (again D-K effect)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Who would be the responsible/s for implementing this in real projects?\n",
    "  - Data Scientists???\n",
    "  - Project Managers???\n",
    "  - Engineers???\n",
    "  - Donald The Duck???\n",
    "  - Rene Descartes???\n",
    "  - My 96 year aunt???\n",

    "  - Embarrassing questions that can come out of these tests, so...\n",
    "  - \"If you don't have do those tests, you don't have a problem\""
